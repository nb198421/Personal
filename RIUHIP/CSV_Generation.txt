SELECT RID
FROM (
SELECT 
ROWID RID, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY 
HISTORY_SEQ
ORDER BY ROWID) RN
FROM CCI_INDV_PRGM_ST)
WHERE RN <> 1);

If there is any records coming up and use below delete query to remove records.
delete FROM CCI_INDV_PRGM_ST
WHERE ROWID IN (
SELECT RID
FROM (
SELECT 
ROWID RID, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY 
HISTORY_SEQ
ORDER BY ROWID) RN
FROM CCI_INDV_PRGM_ST)
WHERE RN <> 1);
commit;


ii)
Select * FROM CCI_INDV
WHERE ROWID IN (

HISTORY_SEQ
ORDER BY ROWID) RN
FROM CCI_INDV)
WHERE RN <> 1);

If there is any records coming up and use below delete query to remove records.
delete FROM CCI_INDV
WHERE ROWID IN (

HISTORY_SEQ
ORDER BY ROWID) RN
FROM CCI_INDV)
WHERE RN <> 1);
commit;

iii)
Select * FROM CCI_INDV_ALIAS
WHERE ROWID IN (
SELECT RID
FROM (
SELECT 
ROWID RID, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY 
HISTORY_SEQ
ORDER BY ROWID) RN
FROM CCI_INDV_ALIAS)
WHERE RN <> 1);


If there is any records coming up and use below delete query to remove records.
delete FROM CCI_INDV_ALIAS
WHERE ROWID IN (
SELECT RID
FROM (
SELECT 
ROWID RID, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY 
HISTORY_SEQ
ORDER BY ROWID) RN
FROM CCI_INDV_ALIAS)
WHERE RN <> 1);
commit;


iv)
Select * FROM CCI_INDV_LINK
WHERE ROWID IN (
SELECT RID
FROM (
SELECT 
ROWID RID, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY 
MCI_ID,
SYSTEM_CD
ORDER BY ROWID) RN
FROM CCI_INDV_LINK)
WHERE RN <> 1);


If there is any records coming up and use below delete query to remove records.
delete FROM CCI_INDV_LINK
WHERE ROWID IN (
SELECT RID
FROM (
SELECT 
ROWID RID, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY 
MCI_ID,
SYSTEM_CD
ORDER BY ROWID) RN
FROM CCI_INDV_LINK)
WHERE RN <> 1);
commit;

v)
Select * FROM CCI_INDV_LINK
WHERE ROWID IN (
SELECT RID
FROM (
SELECT 
ROWID RID, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY 
MCI_ID,
SYSTEM_ID
ORDER BY ROWID) RN
FROM CCI_INDV_LINK)
WHERE RN <> 1);

If there is any records coming up and use below delete query to remove records.
delete FROM CCI_INDV_LINK
WHERE ROWID IN (
SELECT RID
FROM (
SELECT 
ROWID RID, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY 
MCI_ID,
SYSTEM_ID
ORDER BY ROWID) RN
FROM CCI_INDV_LINK)
WHERE RN <> 1);
commit;

2. Login to specific Pentaho server with proper credentials:
3. Go to below location /home/penri/CCI-files and make some folder like <Month><Date> and copy all CSV files to that folder
4. 	Verify MCI Database Credentials in kettle.properties located at
        /home/penri/.kettle
		
		kettle.properties should have correct MCI Schema Name and passwords, DB Name 
		
5.Run the ETL job using commands given below.
                 # cd /opt/data-integration 
		sh kitchen.sh -file:/home/penri/netrics-kjb/j_sit_csv_table_extract.kjb -log:/home/penri/extract.log
		
		
6. It should exit without any error.
